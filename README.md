# Flappy bird

After finding out that the relative location of the window on the screen can be read out using javascript, i wanted to make a simple application which makes use of this mechanic.

Hereby I present the WORST CONTROL INTERFACE for a flappy bird style game. 

## How to play
1. clone the repo
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm run dev -- --open```
4. Play by moving the browser window. Reload the page when game-over.


### Disclaimer
This game is not finished and only shows the minimal playable game logic. It does not include any design or game art and lacks MANY features.
